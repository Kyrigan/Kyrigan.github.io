		<h1>2010 - Artsy and the Geek</h1>
		<p>Once upon a time, in a far away land, there lived a man renowned for his good looks, charm, and popularity. However, he was also known for his short temper and harassment of those he deemed below him. On his birthday, he decided to throw a party, for himself. As he was accepting his numerous gifts at the door, a lowly nerd wanted to join the party, and when it was his turn, he gave the man a Fireball Rose. The man outrightly rejected the nerd, deeming him and his gift "uncool". The nerd warned the man that he and his gift were not what they seemed, and were more valuable than their appearances. But still, the man again rejected the nerd, and would not let him enter. The nerd revealed that he was actually, a "pretty cool dude", and a terrible curse was placed upon the man. The curse could only be broken by the acceptance of girl, and her invitation to a party. He left for university soon after, and has waited in John Hodgins Castle for the opportunity to break that curse year in, and year out. But who could ever learn to love... a Geek?</p>

		<h1>2009 - Mathemadness</h1>
		<p>Kyle has just started his first day at McMaster University. He did pretty well in High School math and physics and he kind of liked it, sort of, and so he chose to pursue a life in engineering leave his small hometown for the bright lights of Hamilton, Ontario. Although a bit nervous, Kyle is excited to make new friends, learn new things, and eat ungodly amounts of Raman Noodles. What Kyle doesn’t know is that his world is about to be inverted. Like a matrix. Or that movie, “The Matrix” (man, that would have made a great play). That is to say, nothing Kyle has ever experienced has prepared him for the road that lies ahead of him at McMaster with the arrival of a new presence so heinous and dreadful that the very fabric of the school, and engineering with it, is in jeopardy of tearing apart.</p>

		<h1>2008 - The Transducers</h1>
		<p>Ten years ago, McMaster engineers were about to make history and completely revolutionize the world.  This is the story of Tina and Jess; two engineering students tired of the daily grind of life at Mac and constantly dreaming of escape to the sunny beaches of Rio.  Not able to take it anymore, they came up with a simple plan: take out a huge loan from some legitimate financial backers, put on an abysmally horrific show based on a notorious physics professor, then whisk away with the money to beautiful Rio.  But what happens when your show becomes a smash success?  Ten years later, we have an answer. The first semi-historically (in)accurate Mac Eng Musical in history, featuring hilarious and memorable characters, the most elaborate dances to date and a completely different show within!</p>

Then one night, quite by accident Jack stumbles across the most peculiar thing he has ever seen: The Arts Quad! Immediately infatuated with all he sees Jack sets out to make arts his own and bring it to the rest of the engineers for them to enjoy. Its not long before his misguided enthusiasm leads him to his grand plan of improving the arts! A plan with consequences! Will the consequences be disastrous? Dire? Catastrophic? Or will they be splendid and serendipitous? Well that’s what you pay the ticket price for people.</p>

		<h1>2006 - Hooke</h1>
		<p>Wendy is an energetic idealistic Engineering frosh when she first arrives at Mac but after a while she begins to feel crushed under the weight of assignments and tests. Near the breaking point, she asks herself if this is really what engineering life is all about? Then as if on cue (mostly because it IS on cue) a drunken engineer named Peter Pan –the boy who never graduates— stumbles through her residence room window and shows her what university life is really all about: drinking, partying, having fun and taking classes over and over and over and over and over again. After all, what’s the rush to graduate? Peter and his rag-tag group of perpetually failing lost students, then whisk Wendy away on a magical tour of the Engineering party-scape...without ever actually leaving the stage! That’s the magic of theatre, folks! The evil Professor Hooke and his army of TA pirates, however, have a very different plan for Wendy. Intent on not losing his job due to gross incompetence Hooke plots to kidnap Wendy and turn her into his star student! Now Peter and the Lost Students must out-smart and out-drink Hooke and his TAs to get back their Wendy back!</p>
